This application is designed to make your life as organizer of speed friending or speed dating events easier. I created this software for a [local speed friending event in Vienna, Austria](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/speed-friending-events/) to give back value to the event organizers. For me, the project additionally serves as a playground for software engineering best practices. The application was implemented in an agile, test-driven development process applying all development best practices so far known to me.

## Installing the application
Install the application dependencies using pip:
```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

AND

sudo apt-get install graphviz evtl
OR yum install graphviz evtl
```

## How to use it
